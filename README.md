# My Personal Project - *Score keeping tool for public speaking competition*

## Project Overview

**Core aspects:**
- **What does it do?** Tracks the scoring details for participants of a public speaking competition
- **Who will use it?** The administrators and contestants of a public speaking competition in an extra curricular youth program
- **Why am I interested?** I am the coordinator for the above event and would like to extend the functionality of crude timer I made last year in Racket
- For more information on the competition visit: http://aircadetleague.com/effective-speaking-program/
## **User stories:**
*As a user, I want to...*
- have Contestants with a name and prepared speech topic
- add a Contestant to a roster of Participants
- edit the name and/or topic of a Contestant
- remove a Contestant from a roster of Participants
- see the names of all the added Participants
- add the duration of a Contestant's speech to their details
- add scores from three judges to a Contestant's details
- calculate a final score based on the average of judges' scores and time penalties and add to a Contestant's details
- save the participants and their details to a text file
- start the score keeper with the last saved list of participants, start fresh if no save file is present
- save the winner (in a brief string statement with their name) to a text file
